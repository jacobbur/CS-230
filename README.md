**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their Android only game Draw It or Lose It to a web based game accessible on multiple platforms. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I feel that the document provides adequate information without too much bloat. It was kept straight and to the point. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

I feel that utilizing a design document helps keep you on track for development. You can easily reference the document as an outline of what needs to be done whenever you need. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I feel that even though I tried to keep everything short and free of bloat, I could have expanded on the evaluations section more. Adding in more detail could have been beneficial in the long run. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

As a software developer, you have not only the responsibility to deliver on the requests of the client, but to also produce a product that meets the needs of the users. In any product that you develop, you need to keep users in mind.
For this project, some things to keep in mind are security and accessibility. Both of which can be simplified by utilizing a cloud-based system. Development for the cloud would include the added benefit of firewall protection from the cloud provider
as well as the accessibility awarded by allowing for devices with little storage to access the game as long as they have an internet connection. 

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

As always, proper OOP is key. Ensuring that future development and iteration can be done in an easy and clean manner is important. I don't believe that I did anything special here. In the future, I would like to better utilize the iteration function.
